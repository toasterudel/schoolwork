Homework 3 Submission for Christopher Rudel
I'm having a very hard time seeing what I did wrong, everything looks right to me (when
does it not look right).
The code won't compile correctly. Hopefully I'll get better at debugging in the future, I 
spent a long time doing it and it didn't amount to much.
