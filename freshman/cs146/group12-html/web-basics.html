    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML was created on the foundation of tags used in previous languages
    such as eXtensible Markup Language (XML). The language created a standardized system for content on the World Wide Web.</p>
    <p>HTML was created in 1991 however it has been updating periodically, with the most recent update in 2016 providing HTML 5.1.</p>
    <h3>Tags</h3>
    <p>Some common tags that are the foundation to HTML include:</p>
    <h5>&lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;</h5>
    <p>This defines the file to be HTML5.</p>
    <h5>&lt;html&gt;</h5>
    <p>This is the root element of the HTML page.</p>
    <h5>&lt;head&gt;</h5>
    <p>This contains meta information about the document.</p>
    <h5>&lt;title&gt;</h5>
    <p>This defines a title for the document.</p>
    <h5>&lt;body&gt;</h5>
    <p>This tag is followed by visible page content</p>
