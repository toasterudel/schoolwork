      <h1>The Waterfall Method</h1>
      <p>This method is a pretty cool technique used to help enhance the design of a software when developing it.
      It was given its name due to the nature of how it flows</p>

      <h3>Requirements and analysis</h3>
      <p>All possible system requirements are gathered during this part of the process</p>
      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>This part creates the architecture of the project, which is pretty important</p>
      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>This is where you get to sit in front of a computer and design your masterpiece! Basically just coding the project.</p>
      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>The fun part of any project is when you get to test out your code and discover any whacky bugs.</p>
      <h3>Deployment</h3>
      <p>Here you get to show off your product to clients and consumers so that they will buy it. </p>
      <h3>Maintenance</h3>
      <p>Basically this is just providing support to customers if anything malfunctions.</p>

    <h2>Requirements Document</h2>
    <p>It is also pretty important to have a requirements document when approaching any project. We had one for this site!</p>
    <p>Generally all requirement documents are concise, however there are 4 main things to address</p>
    <p>The document should: describe the problem, show a basic solution to the problem, express any constraints to the solution, and determine how success will be measured.</p>
