    <h1>History of Computation</h1>
    <p>The abacus was pretty cool, because you could be dumb and still do some math without messing it up.</p>

    <p>Joseph Marie Jacquard was the dude who made punchards a thing, specifically for making a programmable loom.</p>

    <p>In comes Charles Babbage, the father of modern computing, with his difference engines #1 &amp; #2.</p>

    <p>George Boole is who you can thank for having to memorize truth tables for your exams.</p>

    <p>Howard Aiken was a nerd who worked at Big Blue who made some computers that helped us become world war
    champs twice over.</p>

    <p>Apple swooped in with their Apple 1 machine, which was one of the first personal computers.</p>

    <p>Big Blue popularized home computing using parts manufactured by other companies in their IBM PC,
    making windows a big deal</p>

    <h1>History of Communication</h1>
    <img src="http://chiasmuscommunication.com/uploads/3/4/9/5/34959302/7064566_orig.jpg" alt="Communication picture" style="width:325px">

    <p>Communication started with cave paintings, which most everyone has seen before in 2nd grade. Then came writing, which was created way back around 4000 BC. Eventually around 0 AD
    the Chinese made paper which spread into Western Cultures.</p>
    <p>The printing revolution came a little while later, making it easier to produce a lot of print for newspapers.</p>
    <p>In 1843 Samuel Finley Breese Morse built a telegraph system from Washington D.C. to Baltimore. He even created his own language to go along with it! (Morse code)</p>
    <p>From here things pick up pretty quickly, and somehow we go from a two way telephone in 1876, to the telex in 1933, to the fax machine in 1970
    and finally to the internet (Wide Area Network) in 1985.</p>
