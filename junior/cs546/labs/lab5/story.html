          <h3>Driving while tired</h3>
          <p>
            My senior year of high school I was a pretty busy guy in the fall. I would wake up for school at a pretty unreasonable
            hour for a teenager, be at school from 7-2:30, and be at cross country practice until about 4. After that I would get home and nap, 
            then eat, then go to swim practice and get home around 9. After all that I would go and do homework until I had to go to sleep and then
            do it all again.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that out of the way, one day I was getting ready to go to swim practice after doing all my normal
            routine beforehand. I hadn't been able to catch up on my sleep in the previous couple days so I was 
            feeling extremely tired. The drive to swim practice was pretty far being about a half an hour away, but
            I had been doing it for so long I was used to the time. On the drive down I started to feel sleepy, and 
            I was initially pretty good about doing tricks to keep myself awake like rolling down the window on the highway
            or making my seat uncomfortable. After these tricks started to wear off, I allowed myself to close my eyes 
            for what felt like 3 second intervals. One time after closing my eyes and opening them, I awoke to 
            find myself across the yellow line driving directly at a truck. Luckily enough I had enough time to go 
            back to my own lane, and keep driving without any harm done. 
          </p>

            Obviously this experience scared me to bits, and I was wide awake for the rest of the night. Now whenever
            I go out and drive if I start to feel sleepy I just remember this experience and it instantly wakes me
            up. Hopefully I won't have to experience anything so life threatening in the future due to my own ignorance,
            but I'm glad I was able to live through the experience.
