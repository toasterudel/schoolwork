          <h2>Helen Morgan School</h2>
          <p>
            This school was my elementary school, also known as primary school. I was here from first to fifth grade,
            with a single teacher for the whole year for one grade. My favorite class in Helen Morgan was third grade with
            Mrs. Ruvo.

            <h4>Memory from this school</h4>
            In third grade towards the end of the year the class was introduced to musical instruments to see
            if we were interested in playing. I wanted to play a stringed instrument, but I didn't want to be just
            like my sister who played the cello so I picked the viola.

          <h2>Sparta Middle School</h2>
          <p>
            My middle school experience was not too much different from other middle schools. I was 
            at this school from sixth to eight grade, and I would say my favorite class of my time
            there would probably be my eight grade math class. This class could've been difficult
            because it was the first time we were being introduced to linear functions and graphing
            them, but my teacher did a good job to teach the material. He did a great job to assign
            meaningful homework from the textbook, so that we didn't spend hours doing the same
            problems over and over. The learning environment was great, and the teacher was very
            enthusiastic to teach us making it an all around great class. 
          </p>

            <h4>Memory from this school</h4>
            When I was in seventh grade there was a lunch block that was three periods long with each period 
            being 20 minutes. Every single day for lunch I would go up to the art room and play card 
            games with my friends for the first period, eat for the second period, and finally finish my math 
            homework for the last period. I did this every day and it worked out unbelievably well
            (except for the times when I couldn't finish my math homework in time). It doesn't seem like
            much in comparison to the freedom I have now but at the time being able to do that was astonishing.

          <h2>Sparta High School</h2>
          <p>
            High school was also pretty normal in comparison to other high schools. I was here from grades
            nine through twelve. My favorite class at high school was my intro level coding class, where
            we were able to use code to move pictures around and make very rudimentary programs. There
            wasn't much focus on learning data structures, but it was a fun way to introduce high school
            students to coding.  
          </p>

            <h4>Memory from this school</h4>
            My freshman year there wasn't enough space in the cafeteria because all four grades ate at the
            same time. My friends and I were sitting and eating in the hallway because of the lack of space. 
            My one friend was pacing up and down the hallway and eating pudding, when one of us said something
            that made him laugh. He spat out the pudding onto one of my friends and their new girlfriend and
            the wall above them. We all froze for a moment to process what happened, and we all burst out 
            laughing about what he just did. I do feel kinda bad for the guy and girl but I don't think
            they stayed together.

          <h2>Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
          <p>
            So I'm currently at Stevens and I've been here for the past two and a half years. I would say 
            my favorite class so far has been my film class, where we learned about cool film techniques and 
            furthered my understanding of movies. It wasn't the easiest class I've had while I was here,
            but it was one of the more interesting ones I've taken. 
          </p>
          <aside>
            <h4>Memory from the college</h4>
            I don't really feel like a memory from Stevens is appropriate because I am still 
            a student here, so I still have more memories to come!
