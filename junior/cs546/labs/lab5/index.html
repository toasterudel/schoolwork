              <h2>My own story</h2>
              <p>I grew up in a small town in north west New Jersey. As a kid I always wanted
                  to be a writer but I came to realize that writing didn't come naturally to me 
                  and subjects like math were much simpler. I was lucky enough to have a high school that introduced
                  me to programming in my sophomore year, starting with Visual Basic. It was a simple language that 
                  let you move around pictures and taught some of the fundamentals. After that I was able to take the 
                  introductory Java class and finally after that I was able to take AP computer science. After all of 
                  this I was a senior in high school and only had to worry about college applications.
              </p>
              <p>
              After getting into Stevens Institute of Technology I was off to go study computer science and 
              develop into my own person away from my family and high school friends. I was completely unprepared for
              how in depth some of my classes went in their content, and was barely able to keep on track with 
              the help of some friends. After a little bit of acclimation and making a lot of new friends, here I am today.
