#
# To run this file, simply run 
# python3 epinionParser.py
# The program will ask you to Input the filename,
# ensure the file is in the same directory
# so that you can simply put in the file name 
#
#
# The goal of this script is to parse the epinion tree that are listed in the files:
# epinions96.csv, epinions_small.csv, epinions.csv
# and perform data analysis on the results from the parsing
#
# NOTE: epinions_small.csv takes around 3 minutes to run, i do not expect that epinions.csv will run
#
